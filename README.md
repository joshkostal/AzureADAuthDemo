# Azure Active Directory Authentication Demo

I've created a simple example to show how to implement Azure Active Directory Authentication in a ASP.NET Core Web API.

When it is published, I will link the accompanying blog post, which will feature the steps needed to secure your own Web API.

# Technology Stack

I used Yarn as my package manager. The two packages I added were Adal.js and http-server.

I used C# ASP.NET Core to build the Web API and vanilla JavaScript on the client-side.

You will also need an Azure account that's associated with a company (or maybe school) domain.
