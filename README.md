# Azure Active Directory Authentication Demo

I've created a simple example to show how to implement Azure Active Directory in a ASP.NET Core Web API.

To see the steps I took to implement this, click [here](https://blogs.perficientdigital.com/2019/07/10/securing-your-web-api-using-azure-active-directory/).

# Technology Stack

I used Yarn as my package manager. The two packages I added were Adal.js and http-server.

I used C# ASP.NET Core to build the Web API and vanilla JavaScript on the client-side.

You will also need an Azure account that's associated with a company (or maybe school) domain.
